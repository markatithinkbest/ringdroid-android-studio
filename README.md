# ringdroid-android-studio
from: https://github.com/google/ringdroid
I wasn't able to use fork of https://github.com/google/ringdroid directly.
However, after downloading the zip file, I noticed that the real project was in the inner folder. 
So I use Android Studio, File->New->Import Project, D:\2015-06\00\ringdroid-master\ringdroid-master. It worked.
Then share it back in github.
